# University Data Structure Project - Minesweeper
Using C++ OOP to create the classic game, Minesweeper. This program consists of 3 classes.
- Game class (Controls the overall game logic and event handler)
- Board class (Constructs and hold the tile set for players to click)
- Cell class (The tile itself, holding information such as mines or adjacent to mines)

## Additional Features (Still developing)
- A custom tileset and difficulty selection, allows player to select the size and numbers of mines.
- Saving and loading the game state.
